**Goal:** A program that checks for mentions of a plant in 5 different popular blogs/ informational sites.  

**Why:** We want to build a "More Info" blurb that links these sites users can learn more about a plant they're researching. It's impossible for use to write 
full articles about each plant, or aggrergate the amount of information these sites have.
